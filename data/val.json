(Nasdaq: SLDP) have intensified their activities for the\n  development of all-solid-state battery (ASSB) technology through their\n  technology transfer agreement. The latest milestone was the\n  integration of Solid Power\u2019s large-format pure ASSB cells into a BMW\n  i7 technology test vehicle. As of October 2025, Samsung SDI joins the efforts to\n  pursue development and validation of the ASSB technology in the\n  automotive field. The new collaboration marks a key step towards ASSB\n  technology, bringing together the complementary expertise of three\n  industry leaders.Under this arrangement, Solid Power will supply sulfide-based\n  solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI, which Samsung SDI will integrate\n  into separator and/or catholyte and use to build cells, in each case\n  subject to achievement of technical requirements.These cells\n  will be evaluated based on performance parameters and requirements to\n  be agreed between Samsung SDI and BMW Group. Ultimately, Solid Power,\n  Samsung SDI, and BMW aim to develop and supply ASSB cells for\n  integration into a next generation of evaluation vehicles. \u201cWe are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW\n  to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries,\u201d said John\n  Van Scoter, President and CEO of Solid Power. \u201cOur solid electrolyte\n  technology is designed for stability and conductivity, and by working\n  closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we\n  strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.\u201d \"Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately\n  lead to innovation in electric vehicles,\" said Stella Joo-Young\n  Go, Executive Vice President of ASSB Commercialization Team at Samsung\n  SDI. \"Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners\n  like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercializing ASSB.\" Martin Schuster, Vice President Battery Cell\n  and Cell Module at the BMW Group, says: \u201cWith Samsung SDI joining our\n  partnership with Solid Power, we gain significant momentum on our path\n  advancing the development of new battery cell technologies. This\n  global collaboration is another proof point of our overarching goal:\n  to be always in a position to offer our customers state of the art\n  battery technology.\u201dThe partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB\n  technology, and the promise of higher energy density combined with\n  increased safety compared to today\u2019s technologies by replacing liquid\n  electrolytes with solid materials.With increased energy density, longer vehicle ranges can be\n  achieved without having to accept disadvantages in terms of weight of\n  the overall storage system.The BMW Group and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016\n  through an extended \u201cJoint Development Agreement,\u201d which was supported\n  by a BMW Group investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of a\n  financing round. At the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to\n  further deepen their partnership. BMW will operate a solid-state cell\n  prototype line at the CMCC in Parsdorf, on the basis of a research and\n  development license and with Solid Power's experience and expertise. Since 2008, the BMW Group has been consistently\n  building up its competence in the field of battery cell technology.\n  Since 2019, this know-how has been pooled at the BMW Group's Battery\n  Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich. The BCCC covers the entire\n  value chain, from research and development to battery cell design to producibility. In order to be able to quickly and efficiently\n  implement innovations in the field of battery cell technology, the BMW\n  Group cooperates in a network of around 300 partners, including\n  established companies, start-ups and universities, among others.The BMW Group's battery strategy - to operate on\n  equal footing with industry's leading cell manufacturers through deep\n  know-how - has proven its worth. This strategically strong position in\n  the value chain ensures the BMW Group access to all new and innovative\n  battery cell research solutions worldwide.
